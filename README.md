# Information-Retrieval
Information Retrieval related work is here

## Primary objectives
1.	To get started with the necessary tools and techniques required to work with unstructured text corpus.
2.	To have a first-hand building experience of an information retrieval system.

**Corpus Details:**  corpus used in this project is taken from wikipedia and can be found in \data\ folder.

**Analysis done so far:**
* Unigram, bigram and trigram analysis. (Part-1)
* Search index construction. (Part-2A)
* Search implementation. (Part-2B)

**Other Details**
* Code is developed using python 3.8 on jupyter notebook.
* Python Code file name for Part-1: Part-1-Text-Corpus-Analysis.ipynb
* Python Code file name for Part-2A (index construction): Part-2-IndexingCreation-SM.ipynb
* Python Code file name for Part-2B (query): Part-2-Querying-SM.ipynb
* All code files should be placed in same folder.
* Data files must be placed in a folder named “data” in current folder where notebook files are placed.

Program stores the index file, vocabulary and document ids in separate file under “data” folder.

* Place all the files in same folder
* Create a sub-folder by name 'data' and store the wiki_05 file in it.
* All parameter can be edited in the notebook
